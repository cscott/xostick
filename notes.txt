Notes on v5:

- ATtiny261A should be at least ATtiny461a if not ATtiny861a, since
  USB library takes up 2496 bytes.
- full size USB convert to mini or micro? (no through-hole micro-B connectors?)
- LED1/LED2 need better polarity mark
- use '-kit' suffixed versions of footprints (solder mask on component side)
- break off tab appears to work well.
- island between tabs should be anchored to body, not tabs?
- can we avoid anchors on break off tabs, instead use central anchor?
   ie.

     T
where T indicates tabs.

- remove symmetry from USB connector placement to allow two tabs on
  XOrduino board.  (ie, move connector all the way down)
  (but retain 1.9" max width and spacing between USB port and edge to
  allow plugging XO Stick into vertical USB port on XO)
